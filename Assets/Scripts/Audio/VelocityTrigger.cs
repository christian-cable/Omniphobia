///<summary>
///This script exists to play an audio clip once after the object has a velocity.
///This script does so by first setting up the Object's AudioSource & ONSPAudioSource. Then it checks to see if the Object has a rigidbody and if a bool is false, which it should
///     be at the start. If the GameObject has a rigidbody, it will start checking the rigidbody's velocity. If the velocity is above 0, then it plays the AudioClip and sets the
///     boolean variable of the class to true, so that the sound cannot be played again.
///This script requires an AudioSource, an ONSPAudioSource, and if you want the audio to play, it requires a Rigidbody, but it is not as essential as the previous two
///     requirements.
